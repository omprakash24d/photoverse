## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is designed to run within the Firebase Studio environment.

1.  **Dependencies**: `package.json` lists all necessary dependencies. They are typically installed automatically in the Studio environment.
2.  **Environment Variables**: For the application's AI features to function correctly, you need to set up your environment variables. Create a file named `.env` in the root of your project and add the following content. You will need to replace the placeholder value with your actual API key.

    ```env
    # Google AI API Key for Genkit
    # Get this from Google AI Studio: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY
    ```
3.  **Run Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Next.js development server, usually on `http://localhost:9002`.

4.  **Run Genkit Development Server** (for testing/developing AI flows locally):
    In a separate terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    # or for watching changes
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
