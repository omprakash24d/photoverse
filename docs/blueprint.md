# **App Name**: PhotoVerse

## Core Features:

- Photo Input: Allow users to upload photos or capture them via webcam.
- Image Understanding: Use an AI tool (such as CLIP) to derive a text description of an uploaded image, and allow the user to edit it. Alternatively, the user can skip the AI step and provide the image description manually.
- AI Poem Generation: Generate poems based on image descriptions using OpenAI GPT, with options for language (English, Hindi, Hinglish), style (Haiku, Free Verse, etc.), and tone (Joyful, Calm, etc.).
- Poem Display: Display generated poems beautifully alongside or overlaid on the image, allowing users to regenerate or manually edit the poem.
- Download & Share: Enable users to download poems as images, text, or PDFs, and offer one-click sharing to social platforms or direct link generation.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA) to evoke calm and creativity.
- Background color: Very light grayish-lavender (#F5F5FF), almost white, to allow photos and text to take center stage.
- Accent color: Pale rose (#FFB3C6) to subtly draw attention to user controls.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headings and shorter text elements, lending a fashionable, artistic touch.
- Body font: 'Alegreya' (serif) for poem text, offering an elegant, readable, literary feel.
- Simple, outlined icons to maintain a clean and modern look, related to image and text editing actions.
- Mobile-first, responsive layout with clear content separation, emphasizing the visual connection between photo and poem.
