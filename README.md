## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is designed to run within the Firebase Studio environment.

1.  **Dependencies**: `package.json` lists all necessary dependencies. They are typically installed automatically in the Studio environment.
2.  **Environment Variables**: Ensure you have a `.env` file with necessary API keys for Genkit/Google AI if running locally or deploying outside of a pre-configured environment.
    ```env
    # Example .env content (specific keys depend on your Google AI setup)
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY
    ```
3.  **Run Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Next.js development server, usually on `http://localhost:9002`.

4.  **Run Genkit Development Server** (for testing/developing AI flows locally):
    In a separate terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    # or for watching changes
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```

## üîß Available Scripts
